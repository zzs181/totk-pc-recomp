"""Code patch table for the generator: guest instructions replaced in the lifted C, switchable at run time.

Lifted code cannot be byte-patched when the game runs, so a patch is applied when the C is generated. A patch file
(gen.py --patches) has three kinds of lines; `#` starts a comment, fields are separated by whitespace:

  set  <name> <env> <default>               a patch set: a run-time switch <env>=0/1, <default> when it is unset
  site <set> <module> <address> <original> <replacement> [<replacement> ...]

  spin <module> <head> <back-edge> [<back-edge> ...]

  hook <module> <address> <name>

<address> is a module offset (hex), <original> the instruction word the module has there (checked; a mismatch stops
the generator), each <replacement> an instruction word (hex) or `@page:x<n>`, which is `adrp x<n>, <patch page>`
encoded for the site's address. The patch page is the first 4 KiB page after main's image (layout.py leaves the rest
of the 2 MiB-aligned module slot free); the runtime commits it and owns its contents. Words in use, by byte offset:
+0..15 the frame-rate step (runtime/frame_rate.c), +16..55 the output, swapchain and scene sizes
(runtime/resolution.c res_init), +56..59 the camera's aspect ratio (runtime/resolution.c res_init, set aspect), +60..63
the field-of-view factor (runtime/resolution.c res_fov_live, set fov), +92..95 the sun shadow map size
(runtime/resolution.c shadow_init, set shadow). A new set takes words outside these.

The replacement words are lifted at the site's address in place of the original instruction, and the generated C reads
`if (rt_patch_on[<set>]) { replacement } else { original }`: one byte load and a branch per executed site. Several
sets may patch one address (cheats that write different values there): `if (a) {..} else if (b) {..} else {..}`, the
first set in file order wins. The original may be any instruction but br, blr and ret; a replacement's last word may be
a bl (lifted with the site's return address), a b or b.cond / cbz / tbz (its target joins the function's labels when
inside it) or a ret; earlier words must not branch. Every alternative of a site writes the same flags. The generator
writes patches.h (set names, switches, the page address) next to layout.h for the runtime.

A `spin` line names a spin wait found by tools/spin_waits.py: a loop with head <head> that only another thread can end,
and the direct branches back to it (module offsets). Each back-edge (checked: a b, b.cond, cbz / cbnz or tbz / tbnz to
<head>) is lifted as `rt_spin_gate(c, <head>); goto <head>`, which keeps every register and only adds time
(runtime/kernel.c kern_spin_gate).

A `hook` line names a host hook: the function at <address> keeps its name, but every caller now reaches
`rt_hook_run(<slot>, c, f_<address>_body)` (runtime/hook.c), which hands the frame to the runtime function bound to
<name>, or calls the body straight away when none is bound. The hook sees the caller's registers as the call leaves
them -- c->x[30] is the return address the caller wrote before the call, c->v[] its vector registers -- may call
body(c) once, and may leave its own values behind: what the caller reads after the call is what the hook left. That is
how a per-call constant the game computes for a 30 Hz frame is corrected for a faster one (weeping-of-the-empire's
totk_effect_sway.cpp and its siblings, MIT): the hook runs only at the call it names, and every other call of the same
function is the original. <address> must be a function start, or the wrapper would never be reached. A hook binds
itself at start (rt_hook_bind), so no guest address appears in the runtime and one hook serves every game version.
